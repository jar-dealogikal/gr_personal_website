								About Me
							</h2>
							<p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-500">
								I am Genesis and I am a student in IT at ACLC Mandaue at the
								present time. The pleasure I take in programming leads me to
								learn and utilize several coding languages and tech. Outside of
								what I study, I love to sing and regularly find delight in
								expressing myself through music.Cooking is another love of mine;
								I love experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. While I
								have some time to myself, I enjoy playing guitar and singing
								sometimes, which seems to me an ideal way to relax. In addition
								to what I like, I also greatly enjoy photography, which lets me
								take beautiful photos through a lens. My entry into trading
								cryptocurrency has unveiled to me the context of finance and
								investment. My curiosity drives me to learn constantly, whether
								thatâ€™s a new ability or an alternative view; I think that for
								continuous growth, personal and professional, learning is
								essential.
